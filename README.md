# Database
Design and Implementation of an SQL Database

The database was designed to handle various aspects of business operations, including client information, invoices, and payments. It ensures data integrity and efficient retrieval through a structured schema and optimized queries.

I took the following steps to create my analysis:
1. Defined the requirements and data model for the database.
2. Created the database schema with tables for clients, invoices, and payments.
3. Established relationships between tables using foreign keys.
4. Inserted sample data to test the functionality and integrity of the database.
5. Optimized the database with indexing and query tuning for better performance.
